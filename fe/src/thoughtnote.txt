=> first i created homecover, header, footer, and slider js components 

=> I implemented all those components based on my previous codes used while 
developing e-commerce frontend using html,css and js

=> After that i placed all those components in a single main component called Home.js component 

=> I also included same images used in earlier

=> Also i included bootstrap links , fontawesome and google fonts links in the index.html file
